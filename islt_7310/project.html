        <h4>7305 Foundations of Library and Information Science: Critical Essay</h4>
        <div class="foundations">
            <div class="foundationsa">
                <h6>Goal 1: To ground students in history, values, ethics, and guiding principles of the information professions.
                <br>SLO 1: Graduates will apply the core principles, ethics, values, and body of knowledge to questions in library and information science, according to their area of specialty.</h6>
                <p>Course Description: “The essay presents a highly polished, rigorous, argument concerning the focus topic. It follows your chosen style guide format and uses research methods discussed in the course. There are a range of options in the format of the assignment -- that builds on the outline. The final project must be equivalent to 2,500-3,500 words. The aim is to produce a superior piece of work for your ePortfolio. When you plan your term project, envision a study that will demonstrate your expertise in one focused subject area we cover in the course.”</p>
            </div>
        <div class="foundationsb">
            <p>Strengths: Research, organization, and well-formed arguments.</p>
            <p>Weaknesses: APA citation and general editing.</p>
            <p>What I learned: Library donation policy is a tricky subject that requires both adherence to library ethical principles and good public relations skills.</p>
            <p>What I’d do differently: I would find an outside reader to edit my work, as I can get into my own headspace and not see glaring errors that still need correcting.</p>

        <h4>7313 Collection and Access Management: Collection Analysis</h4>
        <div class="awards"> 
            <div class="awardsa">
            <h6>Goal 2: To provide students with the evaluative and analytical skills to respond flexibly and adaptably to future changes and challenges within the organizations and institutions where they will be employed.
            <br>SLO 2: Graduates will apply management principles and interdisciplinary best practices in library and information agency environments.</h6>
            <p>Course Description: “In this assignment you will explain a collection analysis project for a library of your choosing using the methods presented in the course material and text -- specifically our Evaluation & Assessment lecture, readings, and discussion. Your approach may be quantitative or qualitative, use- and user-based or collection-based. Finally, your submission should be in the form of a fluid essay; visuals are most welcome to make your points clear. Make use of headings and an outline, and write in a general style appropriate for presentation to an audience of administrators or directors.”</p></div>
        <div class="awardsb">
            <p>Strengths: Considering my lack of professional experience, I think the overall quality of the essay is good. The sources are good, and the arguments themselves are well reasoned.</p>
            <p>Weaknesses: Again, editing seems to be a concern with this paper. The analysis itself is somewhat simple and limited.</p>
            <p>What I learned: List checking analysis of a library collection is a relatively quick and easy way to judge library’s collection. However, it is limited in its effectiveness as the evaluation is only as useful and the list itself. If the list is biased, the analysis will be as well.</p>
            <p>What I’d do differently: I felt it could have used another method of analysis as list checking is fairly limited, but I was not familiar with collection analysis and should have questioned more professionals on the topic.</p>

        <h4>7301 Introduction to Information Technology: Technology Literature Review</h4>
        <div class="legacies">
            <div class="legaciesa">
            <h6>Goal 3: To provide students with opportunities to develop cutting-edge technological skills and competences used across the information professions.
            <br>SLO 3: Graduates will be competent in information organization and lifecycle activities techniques of organization of information and with using and evaluating technologies of the information professions.</h6>
            <p>Course Description: “Over the past 13 weeks of class, you've been reviewing a particular topic of new technology with respect to how it is being realized in libraries and/or other information agencies. Now, it is time for you to put your research together in a short analytical literature review. Your literature review will survey the LIS and related literature on your topic, allowing you to analyze trends in that literature and make conclusions about the future of your particular technology topic in LIS.”</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="legaciesb">
            <p>Strengths: Organization, research, and writing.
             Weaknesses: Needed more detail on how the resources were found for the introduction. The conclusion could also be longer and more detailed.</p>
            <p>What I learned: Digital legacies are a complex and sometimes painful issue. Libraries have the ability to aid patrons in creating, curating, protecting, and accessing their digital legacies in ways that work best for them.</p>
            <p>What I’d do differently: Time management. There were resources I wish I had more time to fully engage with during the research process.</p>

        <div class="crochet">
            <div class="crocheta"><h6>Goal 4: To develop an appreciation of the service-based and user-focused nature of the information professions.<br>
            SLO 4: Graduates will be able to assess community needs, formulate plans to respond to users of information agencies, and instruct users in using informational resources.</h6>
            <p>Course Description: “Libraries may seem like “an unknown region” to some people. Finding aids are a useful information tool for library users. Librarians create pathfinders to help people find their way to factual, authoritative information on specific topics. Good pathfinders contain a variety of sources of unbiased information, including electronic and print resources, as well as selected Web resources, to support multiple patron learning styles. Your LibGuide will demonstrate both your command of reference sources and your understanding of the population you work with and how sources might benefit them.”</p></div>
        <div class="crochetb"><p>Strengths: Well-designed and thoroughly researched.</p>
        <p>Weaknesses: Crochet is an odd topic to cover for a LibGuide at an academic institution. However, it’s a topic I know enough about to feel comfortable to construct the guide for it.</p>
        <p>What I learned: Keep internet resources simple. Descriptions should be kept short for the audience. Users also appreciate a coherent, pleasing design.</p>
        <p>What I’d do differently: Time management. I would start this project earlier in the semester. That would have given me more time to consider other subject options that might be more appropriate for a university audience.</p>
