    <h3>Welcome to my Library Science Portfolio page!</h3>
    <p>
    This portfolio will provide a record of growth throughout my Masterâ€™s program of Library and Information Science at the University of Missouri iSchool. It will reflect the various skills and lessons learned throughout my course of study. I include samples of course work that act illustrations of the four stated student learning objectives. I outline the strengths and weaknesses I find in my work to further explore my growth in the program and to identify areas of potential improvement. The University of Missouri iSchool includes several signature assignments that students fulfill throughout their course of study. This website is intended as a showcase for those projects.</p>
